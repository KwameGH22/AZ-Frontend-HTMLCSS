Assignment: Introduction to CSS

Task Description:
In this assignment, you will explore the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and apply various styling techniques to modify the appearance of a simple HTML webpage. By the end of this assignment, you should have a solid understanding of CSS properties and how to use them to style different elements on a webpage. You will be required to create an HTML file that incorporates these concepts and submit it on GitHub. You will then share the GitHub repository link via Microsoft Teams.

Instructions:

Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository
1. Create a new GitHub repository for this assignment.
2. Give the repository a descriptive name, such as "AZ-Frontend-HTMLCSS"

Step 2: Create an HTML File
1. Create a new HTML file named "css.html" in your local development environment.
2. Open the HTML file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

Step 3: Implement the Required Tasks
You need to complete the following tasks within the HTML file:

Task 1: Basic Styling
1. Inside the <body> tag, create a simple web page with a heading, paragraph, and an unordered list of three items.
2. Within the <head> section of "css.html", add an internal CSS style block using the <style> tags.
3. Apply the following styles to the HTML elements in the web page created in Task 1.

Set the font family of the <body> element to "Arial, sans-serif".
Give the heading a background color of your choice.
Set the font size of the paragraph to 16 pixels.
Add a left margin of 20 pixels to the unordered list.

Task 2: External CSS
1. Create a new external CSS file named "styles.css". Link the "styles.css" file to "css.html" by adding a <link> tag in the <head> section.
2. Save the "css.html" file and ensure that the styles defined in "styles.css" are correctly applied to the HTML elements.

Task 3: Selectors and Properties
Within "styles.css", add the following additional styles.

Use a class selector to give the heading a different background color.
Apply a border with a 1-pixel solid line and a padding of 10 pixels to the unordered list.
Change the color and font weight of the list items.
Add a hover effect to the list items, such as changing the background color or text color.

Step 4: Commit and Push to GitHub
1. Add the modified HTML file to your local Git repository.
2. Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message.
3. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Step 5: Share the GitHub Repository Link
1. Copy the URL of your GitHub repository.
2. Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to the appropriate assignment channel.
3. Submit the assignment link.

Submission Guidelines:
- Ensure that all the required tasks are completed as described above.
- Double-check your HTML file for any errors or typos.
- Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- Share the GitHub repository link via Microsoft Teams.
