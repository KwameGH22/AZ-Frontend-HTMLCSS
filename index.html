    <h1>Kwame's HTML Page</h1><hr>
    <p><strong> The purose of this webpage is to demonstrate my understanding of the basic structure of an HTML document,
        HTML tags and elements and text formating.</strong> <hr>
    </p>
    <p>So in the next <i>5 years</i> if Jehovah God permits, i wish to have gained the nessary skills to work as <del>Cloud Engineer</del><em><strong><ins>Fullstack software
        developer.</ins></strong></em><br>
        As a fullstack devloper, it means that i would be able to build both the <mark>frontend and backend</mark> of my web applications.<br>
        My role of a fullstack developer as i have gathered through my research would entail learning frameworks like:<br> 
        <ul style = "font-weight: bold">
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Express.js</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>Firebase</li>
            <li>Django</li>
            <li>etc</li>

        </ul> in addition to frontend frameworks and libraries like:
        <ol style = "font-weight: bold">
            <li>React.js</li>
            <li>React-Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Material UI</li>
            <li>Redux.js</li>
            

        </ol>among others.
        Am fully aware that this journey would not be an easy one but i believe with <a href="https//www.azubiafrica.org" target="_blank">Azubi Africa</a>
        this dream will certainly come true, come the <b><small>next five years.</small></b><br>
        With that said it also means that on my part i must show committment
        and dedication to this aspiration.
