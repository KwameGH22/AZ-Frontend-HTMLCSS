            <h1>Kwame's Webpage</h1>
            <p id="A1">My name is Kwame and i can describe myself with the following adjectives; <b><i>selfless, passionate, resilient, inquisitive, meticulous and committed.</i></b>
                I love the life sciences and for that matter Science in general but for the past five years I have become particularly fascinated about computers and the internet. 
                Its rather unfortunate that i discovered this passion quite late in my life but as the saying goes its better late than never.
                 Am awed by the science and logic behind software development and that is why i decided to delve further into software development.
            I always say that, that single individual or team that dreamt about the possibility of building computers and the related systems is/are genius. 
            What i also find mindboggling is how computer scientists came up with the idea for building programming languages to write softwares.</p>
        Aside programming am also interested in:
            <ol>

                <li>Cars</li>
                <li>Philosophy</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>My Front-end Development Journey</h1>
            <p>I believe <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> and <a href="https://www.w3chools.com" target="_blank">W3schools</a> are great resources for anyone interested in programming.
                These free resources, i must say have really helped in my journey thus far and i would recommend them for newbies. 
                Coding i must confess is not for the faint-hearted especially those who intend to do so informally. To succeed on your own you definitely need these <a href="#A">character traits.</a></p>
